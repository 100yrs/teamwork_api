The Teamwork API gem allows you to consume the Teamwork API

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'teamwork_api'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install teamwork_api

## Usage

Over time this project intends to have a full Teamwork API. At the moment there are only a
few endpoints available:

```ruby
client = TeamworkApi::Client.new('https://yoursite.teamwork.com')
client.api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'

# Project endpoints
client.projects                                 #=> Gets all projects
client.project(57)                              #=> Gets the project with id 57
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
