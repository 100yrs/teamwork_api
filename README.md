The Teamwork API gem allows you to consume the [Teamwork API](https://developer.teamwork.com/)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'teamwork_api'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install teamwork_api

## Usage

Over time this project intends to have a full Teamwork API. At the moment there are only a
few endpoints available:

```ruby
client = TeamworkApi::Client.new('https://yoursite.teamwork.com')
client.api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'

# Project endpoints
client.projects                                 #=> Gets all projects

client.delete_project(57)                       #=> Deletes the project with id 57
client.create_project(                          #=> Creates a new project
